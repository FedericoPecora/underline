# The underline package

This LaTeX package provides a robust command for underlining text. It combines the following features:

* underlining is interrupted so as to not intersect descenders;
* underlining works across line breaks, page breaks, and hyphenation;
* underlined can be combined with other common formatting, such as \textit, \textbf, \em, and \bf;
* underlining works both within and around math mode.

The implementation derives form a solution originally posted by Peter Grill (see the thread [https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/125219/using-soul-with-indirect-formatting-applied]["Using soul with indirect formatting applied" on StackExchange]) which builds on the soul package.
