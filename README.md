# The ```underline''' package

This LaTeX package provides a robust command for underlining text. It combines the following features:

* underlining is interrupted so as to not intersect descenders;
* underlining works across line breaks, page breaks, and hyphenation;
* underlined can be combined with other common formatting, such as ```\textit''', ```\textbf''', ```\em''', and ```\bf''';
* underlining works both within and around math mode.
