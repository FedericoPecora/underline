The underline LaTeX package provides a robust command for underlining
text. It combines the following features:

-- underlining is interrupted so as to not intersect descenders;

-- underlining works across line breaks, page breaks, and hyphenation;

-- underlined can be combined with other common formatting, such as
   \textit, \textbf, \em, and \bf;

-- underlining works both within and around math mode.

The implementation derives form a solution originally posted by Peter
Grill which builds on the soul package - see the thread "Using soul
with indirect formatting applied" on StackExchange:
